Variables:
Instance Variables: 
	Objects states are stored in instance variables .
	Their values are unique to each instance.
Class Variable:
	Class variables are defined with static keyword.  Can also add final statement to make it not to change.
	One copy of this variable in existence.
Local variables:
	Within method.  These variable need to be assigned with default  values before using  or compiler warnings. 
Parameters:
	Parameters always classified as variables not fields.
Primitive Data Types:
Byte: 
	8 bit
Short: 
	16  bit
Int:
	32 bit
Long:
	64 bit
Float:
	32 bit , This data type should not be used for precise values , such as currency. Use java.math.GigDecimal instead.
Double:
	64 bit ,This data type should not be used for precise values , such as currency. Use java.math.GigDecimal instead.
Boolean:
 
Char: 
	16 bit.
	Data Type	Default Value (for fields)
	byte	0
	short	0
	int	0
	long	0L
	float	0.0f
	double	0.0d
	char	'\u0000'
	String (or any object)  	null
	boolean	false
 
 
Literals:
	· Unicode escape sequences may be used elsewhere in a program (such as in field names, for example), not just in char or String literals.
	· null is often used in programs as a marker to indicate that some object is unavailable.
	· you can use an underscore character to separate digits in groups of three, similar to how you would use a punctuation mark like a comma, or a space, as a separator. 
	But not in 
	•At the beginning or end of a number
	•Adjacent to a decimal point in a floating point literal
	•Prior to an F or L suffix
	•In positions where a string of digits is expected
	 
	 
 
 
 
Operators:
The instanceof operator compares an object to a specified type.
When using the instanceof operator, keep in mind that null is not an instance of anything.
 
Bitwise and Bit Shift Operator:

Control flow Statements :
